So that's been a big part of how we've tried to emphasize and develop threads and over time, if you want it to be ubiquitous, you obviously wanna be welcome to everyone, but I think how you see the networks and the culture that you create there, I think ends up being pretty important for how they scale over time. Or with Facebook we started with this real name culture and it was grounded to your college email address and now it obviously hasn't been grounded to your college email address for a very long time, but I think the kind of real authentic identity aspect of Facebook has continued and continued to be an important part of it. So I think how we set the culture for threads early on in terms of being a more positive, friendly place for discussion will hopefully be one of the defining elements for the next decade as we scale it out. We obviously have a lot of work to do, but I'd say it's off to a quite a good start. I mean it's, and obviously there was the huge spike and then not everyone who tried it out originally is gonna stick around immediately.

Then from there you want to get to something that is retentive so that way people who have a good experience with a thing come back and want to keep using it.

And part of this overall is just how you tune the algorithm to basically encourage either recency or quality, but less recency. So I'm not sure that we have that balance exactly right yet it may be the case that in a product like Threads where people may want to see more recent content as opposed to something like an Instagram or Facebook where it's more visual and the balance might just be towards balancing towards maybe a little more quality even if it's 12 hours ago instead of two hours ago. So I think that this is the type of stuff that we need to tune and kind of optimize, but yeah, I think I agree with that point. - This hasn't happened yet with Threads, but you're eventually gonna hook it into Activity Pub, which is this decentralized social media protocol. - Yeah. - It's kind of complicated in layman's terms, but essentially people run their own servers. So instead of having a centralized company run the whole network, people can run their own fiefdoms. It's federated. - [Mark Zuckerberg] Yeah. - So Threads will eventually hook into this. - [Mark Zuckerberg] Yeah, yeah. - This is the first time you've done anything I think really meaningful in the decentralized social media space. - Yeah and we're building it from the ground up. - Yeah. - I mean, I've always believed in this stuff, I mean, a lot of this hasn't- - I mean, because you run the largest centralized social media platform."

And I think that there's value in being on one of these protocols, but it's not the only way to deliver value. So the opportunity cost of doing this massive transition is is kinda this massive thing, but when you're starting from scratch you can just design it so it can work with that. And we wanted to do that with this because I thought that that was one of the interesting things that's evolving around this kinda the Twitter competitive space as a lot of the others.

And like I get that not everyone is gonna wanna use everything that we build. I mean, that's obviously the case. I mean, it's like, okay we have 3 billion people using Facebook, but not everyone wants to use one product. And I think the making it so they can use an alternative, but can still interact with people on the network will make it so that that product also is more valuable. You can increase the quality of the product by making it so that you can give people access to all the content, even if it wasn't created on that network itself. - Hmm. - So, I don't know. I mean, it's a bet. - Yeah. - I think it takes some confidence, but I don't know. I think it's both good to give people choice.

So, I don't know, I think it's maybe for phase one of social networking it was fine to like have these systems that people felt a little more locked into, but I think for the mature state of the ecosystem, I don't think that that's gonna be where it goes. So I dunno, I'm pretty optimistic about this. And then if we can build Threads on this then maybe we can over time as the standards get more built out, it's possible that we can spread that to more of the stuff that we're doing. - Hmm. - We're certainly working on Interop with messaging. - Yeah. - And I think that that's been an important thing. The first step was kind of getting Interop to work between our different messaging systems. - Right, so we can talk to each other. - Yeah and then the first decision there was, okay, well WhatsApp, you know, we have this very strong commitment to encryption. So if we're gonna Interop, then we're either gonna make the others encrypted or we're gonna have to decrypt WhatsApp. And it's like, all right, well we're not gonna decrypt WhatsApp, so we're going to go down the path of encrypting everything else, which we're making good progress on, but that basically has just meant completely rewriting Messenger and Instagram direct from scratch. So you're basically going from a model where all the messages are stored in the cloud. It's like you're completely inverting the architecture where now all the messages are stored locally and just the way that they're- - While the plane's in the air. - Yeah, yeah. So I mean, that's been sort of this like, heroic effort by just like a hundred or more people over like a multi-year period. And we're basically getting to the point where it's starting to roll out now, but you know now that we're at the point where we can do encryption across those apps, we can also start to support more Interop. Which I think is gonna be interesting too. - With other services like Meta that Meta doesn't own other messaging apps. - Yeah well I mean, the plan was always to start with Interop that between our services, and then to get to that, but yeah, we're starting to experiment with that too. - I promise to stop bringing up Elon, but you and he were together with Senator Chuck Schumer at the White House recently for this big AI summit and a lot of it was closed. - Along with a lot of other people. - Along with a lot of other people.

And when other people adopt the stuff, it increases volume and drives down prices. So if you look at stuff like- - Like PyTorch for example, - Well, when I was talking about driving down prices, I was thinking about stuff like open compute. - Yeah. - Where we open sourced our server designs and now the factories that are making those kind of servers can generate way more of them because other companies like Amazon and others are designing this or like ordering the same designs that drives down the price for everyone, which is good. PyTorch is great because it basically makes it, that it's like the standard across the industry as people develop with this, which means that more libraries and modules are created for it, which just makes it better and it makes it better for us to develop internally too. So, and then all that stuff is true and works well for open source. And also I think it's pretty well established that open source software is it's generally more secure"

And then also because there's sort of a standard and that's deployed across the industry, those fixes get rolled out everywhere, which is a big advantage for safety and security. And when I think about AI safety, I think one of the big issues, if there's like a single super intelligence and it's closed and someone figures out how to exploit it, then like everyone kinda gets screwed at the same time. Whereas in an open source system, it's like okay, people find issues and just like your Mac or whatever gets patched right, it's like people find the issues and then it just gets rolled out across the industry. - Yeah. - So I think that's generally positive, but there's obviously this whole debate where when you open source stuff, I mean, we can build in safeguards, but if you open source something you're not fundamentally gonna be able to prevent bad guys from taking that and running with it too.

So I think you gotta be careful about that. So I do think the regulatory capture thing I think you need to be careful about for things like that because I do think one of the big benefits of open source is it also just decreases the cost of adoption for small companies and a lot of other folks. So I do think that's gonna be a big thing. - Which I think Llama and the Llama Two release has been a big thing for startups because it is so free. - Yeah. - Or just easy to use access. - Yeah. - And I guess I'm wondering, did you ever, was there ever debate internally about"

People wanna interact with Kylie, Kylie wants to cultivate her community, but there are only so many hours in a day. - Right. - So creating an AI that's sort of an assistant for her or it'll be clear to people that they're not interacting with like the physical Kylie Jenner. It would be kinda an AI version and that'll help the creators and I think it'll be fun for consumers. That one's actually really hard.

I mean this isn't code in the deterministic sense. It's like a model that you need to be able to train it to stay within certain bounds.

So we're experimenting with a bunch of different AI's for different interests that people have, whether it's interested in different kinds of sports or fashion or- - The one I tried was a travel agent type. - Yeah travel, yeah.

I mean we're at good photorealistic quality, but yeah like you said, I think that- - For people who haven't used it yet, you just type into the bot what you want the image to be and it'll just make it. - Yeah and the fact that it's fast and free I think is gonna be pretty game changing. There are photo realistic image generators out there, but a lot of them, they take a minute. - They're hard to use. You have to have the discord or whatever. - Yeah and you have to pay a subscription fee. - [Interviewer] Yeah. - So I think having it be free, fast, able to exist in group chat threads. I think people are just gonna create a ton of images for fun. And I don't know, I'm really curious to see how this gets used, but I think it's gonna be super fun. I mean, I already just sit there with my kids and we'll just keep on like, I mean the word that you say to get it to make an image is imagine.

So I think that there are all these things where you can use these tools to facilitate connections and just create entertainment, which is actually probably more what the technology is capable of today than even some of the more utility use cases because there is the factuality issue. - Yeah. - But I mean with the hallucinations and all that, and we're trying to address that by doing the partnerships with search engines right, that you mentioned.

And I know a lot of it's private and you wouldn't train on like ever train on like private chats or WhatsApp. - No, we don't. - WhatsApp's encrypted too, but like public stuff, reels, public Facebook posts. - Yeah. - That seems pretty natural for this."

So there's a lot of upside and I think we need to experiment with to see what ends up being useful.

So if you wanna build an AI assistant that really has access to all of the inputs that you have as a person, glasses are probably the way that you wanna build that. - [Interviewer] Yeah. - And so, I don't know, I think that that's just really interesting and compelling, and it's sort of this whole new angle on smart glasses that I thought might materialize over a five to 10 year period. But in this odd twist of the tech industry, I think actually is gonna show up maybe before even super high quality holograms do. - Is overall interest in the Ray Bands and the Quest line kind of tracking with where you thought it would be"

        "text": "And just that did very well and was sort of like the kind of defining VR device so far. Then we shipped Quest Pro, which was making the leap to mixed reality, but it was $1,500. And what we've seen so far is that at least consumers are very cost conscious. So we didn't expect to sell, well sorry, we expected to sell way fewer Quest Pros than Quest Twos and that beared out. - Yeah. - So I think it was like, it's always hard to predict exactly what it'll be when you're shipping a product at $1,500 for the first time. But like, I'd say it was kinda fine with expectations. It wasn't like a grand slam, but it was, it did fine. And now Quest Three is sort of the refinement on mixed reality, kind of like Quest One was, but with Quest Three we're sort of at the point where we've gotten mixed reality, which is even higher quality than what was in Quest Pro, but it's a third of the price right, so it's $500. So I'm really excited to see how that one will go. - It seems like you all, based on my demos, still kind of primarily think of it as a gaming device. Is that fair that the main use cases for Quest Three are gonna be, and these kind of gaming meets social, so you've got Roblox now. - Yeah, yeah, so I think social is actually the first thing, which is interesting. I mean cuz Quest used to be primarily gaming, and now if you look at what experiences are people spending the most time in, it's actually just different social metaverse type experiences. So things like Rec Room, VR Chat, Horizon, Roblox, when it shows up, but that's not, I mean, it's there. It's starting to scale, but I think Roblox can be a lot bigger than it is. But even with Roblox just kind of starting to grow on the platform, social is already more time spent than gaming use cases. - Hmm. - So now it's different if you look at the economics, because people pay more for games. - Sure. - Whereas social kind of has that whole adoption curve thing that I talked about before where first you have to kind of build out the big community and then you can enable commerce and kinda monetize it over time. But this was, I mean, this is sort of my whole theory for VR was people looked at it initially as a gaming device, and I thought, Hey, like I think this is a new computing platform overall. Computing platforms tend to be good for three major things. Gaming, social and communication and productivity. And I'm pretty sure we can nail the social one. If we can find the right partners on productivity, and if we can support the gaming ecosystem, then I think that we can help this become a big thing. So I'd say broadly that's sort of on track. I mean, it was like, I thought it was gonna be a long-term project, but I think the fact that social has now overtaken gaming is the most thing that people are spending the most time on, is an interesting software evolution in how they're used. - -hmm. - But yeah, like you're saying, I mean, entertainment, social, gaming, still the primary things, productivity I think still needs some time. - Yeah. - To develop. - Yeah, I tried the Quest three. It's definitely a meaningful step change in terms of graphics and performance and all the things you guys have put into it. It feels still like we're a little ways away from this medium becoming truly mainstream, becoming something that new. - When you say mainstream do you mean- - Well, I know you're already at kind of console level sales, so you could say that's mainstream, but I guess in terms of like what you could think of as a general purpose computing platform. So even like PC or something like that, like, seems-"

But I know, so for today, when you're building one of these products, you basically have the choice of if you have it at that expensive, then you'll sell hundreds of thousands of units or something. But we're trying to build something where we build up the community of people using it. So we're trying to thread the needle and have the best possible display that we can while having it cost $500, not $3,500. - Yeah, I reported on this some comments you made to employees after Apple debuted Division Pro, and you didn't seem super phased by it. Like it seemed like it didn't bother you as much as it maybe could have. I have to imagine if they released a $700 headset we would be a diff we'd be having a different conversation. - But yeah, I mean- - There should be low volume and they're probably three to four years out of a general, like a lower tier type release that's at any meaningful scale.

And to me that was the thing that I thought we were doing pretty good work, so I thought that was unlikely, but you don't know for sure until you see it. They show up with their thing and there was just nothing like that. Right, so I think that there are some things that they did that are clever.

And yeah I think that there's a bunch of stuff that we just need to polish where it's like the cameras are just so much better. The audio is so much better.

So I think, but look you learn by trying to assemble and integrate everything. You can't just like do a million R&D efforts in isolation and then like hope that they come together. I think part of what lets you get to building the ultimate product is having a few tries practicing building the ultimate product. And it's like, oh, well we did that, but I dunno, it like wasn't quite as good on this one dimension as we wanted, so let's not ship that one. Let's hold that one and then do the next one. So I think that's sort of some of the process that we've had is we have like multiple generations of how we're gonna build this.

I mean that's not the future that we're working towards, but I do think that there's somewhat of a bias, maybe this is in the tech industry or maybe overall where people think that the mobile phone one, the glasses one is sort of the only one of the two that will end up being valuable,"

But I dunno, we go through different waves in terms of like what the company needs to be doing and I think that that calls for somewhat different styles of leadership. And I think we went through a period where a lot of what we needed to do was tackle and navigate some important social issues and I think that that required a somewhat different style. And then we went through a period where we had some quite big business challenges handling in a recession and revenue not coming in the way that we thought and needing to do layoffs and that required a somewhat different style. But now I think we're squarely back in developing really innovative products, especially because of some of the innovations in AI. I think that in some ways that just like plays exactly to, I think my favorite style of running a company. But I don't know, I think these things evolve over time. - It seems like you're having more fun."

So maybe that's exciting. I don't know. I mean I guess personally, I think a lot of people, I mean the world has been so weird"

And I think that that was an opportunity for a lot of people to just sort of like reassess what they found meaningful in their lives. And there's obviously a lot of stuff that was tough about it, but the silver lining is I got to spend a lot more time with my family and we got to just like I could spend more time out in nature cuz I like wasn't coming into the office quite as much and like it was definitely a period of reflection where I sort of, I felt like since the time I was basically, I was like 19 when I started the company. And like every year it's just, okay,"

Let's like make this bigger and bigger and kind of connect more people and build more products that allow people to do that. And I guess we just sort of hit the scale where I think to me what I found sort of satisfaction in life from and what I think is like the right strategy, I think both for like me personally and for the company is less to just focus on like, okay we're gonna just like connect more people and more like, let's do some awesome things and- - Sounds very technical. - I mean there are a lot of different analogies on this, but I mean someone made this point to me that doing good things is different from doing awesome things. And like in social media in a lot of ways it's good, right, like gives a lot of people a voice and it lets them connect and it's like sort of warm and it's taking like a basic technology and bringing it to billions of people, but and that there's an inherent awesomeness of like doing some technical feat for the first time. And I guess I'm for the next phase of what we do, just a little more focused on that. I think we've done a lot of good things."

But for the next wave of, I guess my life and for the company, but also outside of the company, what I'm doing at CZI and it was just some of my personal projects It's like I sort of define my life at this point more in terms of getting to work on awesome things with great people who I like working with. So it's like I work on all this reality lab stuff with Baz and a team over there and it's just super exciting and I get to work on all this AI stuff and it with Chris and Ahmed and like the folks who are working on that and it's really exciting and like we get to work on some of the philanthropy work and helping to cure diseases with Priscilla and a lot of the best scientists in the world and that's really cool. And it's like, okay, and it's like, so just then there's like personal stuff. It's like we get to raise a family. It's like that's really neat and like there's no other person I'd rather do that with. And I don't know, to me that's just sort of where I am in life now. - Sounds like a nice place to be. - , I mean I'm enjoying it. - Mark Zuckerberg, the optimist. - I mean, always somewhat optimistic. - Yeah, thanks for the time, Mark. - Yeah, appreciate it. - Thank you."
